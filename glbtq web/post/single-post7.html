              <p><strong>Ally (Heterosexual Ally, Straight Ally) </strong>Someone who is a friend, advocate, and/or activist for LGBTQ people.
                A heterosexual ally is also someone who confronts heterosexism in themselves and others. The term ally is
                generally used for any member of a dominant group who is a friend, advocate or activist for people in an
                oppressed group (i.e. White Ally for People of Color).</p>
              <p><strong>Androgynous </strong>Term used to describe an individual whose gender expression and/or identity may be neither distinctly
                "female" nor "male," usually based on appearance.</p>
              <p><strong>Asexual </strong>A sexual orientation generally characterized by not feeling sexual attraction or desire for partnered
                sexuality. Asexuality is distinct from celibacy, which is the deliberate abstention from sexual activity.
                Some asexual people do have sex. There are many diverse ways of being asexual.</p>
              <p><strong>Biphobia </strong>The fear, hatred, or intolerance of bisexual people.</p>
              <p><strong>Bisexual, Bi </strong>An individual who is physically, romantically and/or emotionally attracted to men and women. Bisexuals
                need not have had sexual experience with both men and women; in fact, they need not have had any sexual experience
                at all to identify as bisexual.</p>
              <p><strong>Cisgender </strong>a term used to describe people who, for the most part, identify as the gender they were assigned
                at birth.</p>
              <p><strong>Closeted </strong>Describes a person who is not open about his or her sexual orientation.</p>
              <p><strong>Coming Out </strong>A lifelong process of self-acceptance. People forge a lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender identity
                first to themselves and then may reveal it to others. Publicly identifying one's orientation may or may not
                be part of coming out.</p>
              <p><strong>Down Low Pop-culture </strong>term used to describe men who identify as heterosexual but engage in sexual activity with
                other men. Often these men are in committed sexual relationships or marriages with a female partner. This
                term is almost exclusively used to describe men of color.</p>
              <p><strong>Drag Queen/Drag King </strong>Used by people who present socially in clothing, name, and/or pronouns that differ from
                their everyday gender, usually for enjoyment, entertainment, and/or self-expression. Drag queens typically
                have everyday lives as men. Drag kings typically live as women and/or butches when not performing. Drag shows
                are popular in some gay, lesbian, and bisexual environments. Unless they are drag performers, most Trans
                people would be offended by being confused with drag queens or drag kings.</p>
              <p><strong>Gay </strong>The adjective used to describe people whose enduring physical, romantic and/or emotional attractions are
                to people of the same sex (e.g., gay man, gay people). In contemporary contexts, lesbian (n. or adj.) is
                often a preferred term for women. Avoid identifying gay people as "homosexuals" an outdated term considered
                derogatory and offensive to many lesbian and gay people.</p>
              <p><strong>Gender Expression </strong>Refers to how an individual expresses their socially constructed gender. This may refer to
                how an individual dresses, their general appearance, the way they speak, and/or the way they carry themselves.
                Gender expression is not always correlated to an individuals' gender identity or gender role.</p>
              <p><strong>Gender Identity </strong>Since gender is a social construct, an individual may have a self perception of their gender
                that is different or the same as their biological sex. Gender identity is an internalized realization of
                one's gender and may not be manifested in their outward appearance (gender expression) or their place in
                society (gender role). It is important to note that an individual's gender identity is completely separate
                from their sexual orientation or sexual preference.</p>
              <p><strong>Gender Neutral </strong>This term is used to describe facilities that any individual can use regardless of their gender
                (e.g. gender neutral bathrooms). This term can also be used to describe an individual who does not subscribe
                to any socially constructed gender (sometimes referred to as "Gender Queer").</p>
              <p><strong>Gender Non Conforming </strong>A person who is, or is perceived to have gender characteristics that do not conform to
                traditional or societal expectations.</p>
              <p><strong>Gender/Sexual Reassignment Surgery</strong> - Refers to a surgical procedure to transition an individual from one biological
                sex to another. This is often paired with hormone treatment and psychological assistance. A "Transsexual"
                individual must go through several years of hormones and psychological evaluation and live as the "opposite"
                or "desired" gender prior to receiving the surgery (see intersex).</p>
              <p><strong>Gender Role </strong>A societal expectation of how an individual should act, think, and/or feel based upon an assigned
                gender in relation to society's binary biological sex system.</p>
              <p><strong>Heterosexual </strong>An adjective used to describe people whose enduring physical, romantic and/or emotional attraction
                is to people of the opposite sex. Also straight.</p>
              <p><strong>Homosexual (see Offensive Terms to Avoid) </strong>Outdated clinical term considered derogatory and offensive by many
                gay and lesbian people. The Associated Press, New York Times and Washington Post restrict usage of the term.
                Gay and/or lesbian accurately describe those who are attracted to people of the same sex.</p>
              <p><strong>Homophobia </strong>Fear of lesbians and gay men. Prejudice is usually a more accurate description of hatred or antipathy
                toward LGBT people.</p>
              <p><strong>Intersex </strong>People who naturally (that is, without any medical interventions) develop primary and/or secondary
                sex characteristics that do not fit neatly into society's definitions of male or female. Many visibly intersex
                babies/children are surgically altered by doctors to make their sex characteristics conform to societal binary
                norm expectations. Intersex people are relatively common, although society's denial of their existence has
                allowed very little room for intersex issues to be discussed publicly. Has replaced "hermaphrodite," which
                is inaccurate, outdated, problematic, and generally offensive, since it means "having both sexes" and this
                is not necessarily true, as there are at least 16 different ways to be intersex.</p>
              <p><strong>In the Life </strong>Often used by communities of color to denote inclusion in the LGBTQ communities.</p>
              <p><strong>Kinsey Scale </strong>Alfred Kinsey, a renowned sociologist, described a spectrum on a scale of 0 6 to describe the
                type of sexual desire within an individual. 0 Completely Heterosexual - 6: Completely Homosexual. In his
                1948 work Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. The Kinsey Scale is often used to dissect the bisexual community
                and describe the differences between sexual orientation and sexual preference.</p>
              <p><strong>Lesbian </strong>A woman whose enduring physical, romantic and/or emotional attraction is to other women. Some lesbians
                may prefer to identify as gay (adj.) or as gay women.</p>
              <p><strong>LGBTQQIA </strong>An acronym used to refer to all sexual minorities: "Lesbian, Gay/Gender Neutral/Gender Queer, Bisexual/Bigender,
                Transgender/Transvestite/Transsexual, Questioning/Queer, Intersex, and Allies/Androgynous/Asexual."</p>
              <p><strong>Lifestyle (see Offensive Terms to Avoid)</strong> Inaccurate term used by anti-gay extremists to denigrate lesbian,
                gay, bisexual and transgender lives. As there is no one straight lifestyle, there is no one lesbian, gay,
                bisexual or transgender lifestyle.</p>
              <p><strong>Men Loving Men (MLM) </strong>Commonly used by communities of color to denote the attraction of men to men.</p>
              <p><strong>Men Who Have Sex with Men</strong> men, including those who do not identify themselves as homosexual or bisexual, who
                engage in sexual activity with other men (used in public health contexts to avoid excluding men who identify
                as heterosexual).</p>
              <p><strong>Openly Gay</strong> Describes people who self-identify as lesbian or gay in their personal, public and/or professional
                lives. Also openly lesbian, openly bisexual, openly transgender.</p>
              <p><strong>Outing </strong>The act of publicly declaring (sometimes based on rumor and/or speculation) or revealing another person's
                sexual orientation or gender identity without that person's consent. Considered inappropriate by a large
                portion of the LGBT community.</p>
              <p><strong>Pansexual </strong>not limited in sexual choice with regard to biological sex, gender, or gender identity.</p>
              <p><strong>Queer </strong>Traditionally a pejorative term, queer has been appropriated by some LGBT people to describe themselves.
                However, it is not universally accepted even within the LGBT community and should be avoided unless someone
                self-identifies that way.</p>
              <p><strong>Questioning </strong>The process of considering or exploring one's sexual orientation and/or gender identity.</p>
              <p><strong>Sexual Orientation </strong>The scientifically accurate term for an individual's enduring physical, romantic and/or
                emotional attraction to members of the same and/or opposite sex, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and heterosexual
                (straight) orientations. Avoid the offensive term "sexual preference," which is used to suggest that being
                gay or lesbian is voluntary and therefore "curable."</p>
              <p><strong>Sexual Behavior </strong>Refers to an individual's sexual activities or actions (what a person does sexually). Though
                often an individual's sexual orientation is in line with their sexual behavior, it is not always the case.</p>
              <p><strong>Sexual Minority </strong>An all inclusive, politically oriented term referring to individuals who identify with a minority
                sexual orientation, sex identity, or gender expression/gender identity.</p>
              <p><strong>Sexual Preference (see Offensive Terms to Avoid) </strong>This term refers to an individual's choice in regards to attraction.
                Sexual preference can be based on gender/sex, physical appearance (height, weight, race, ethnicity), or emotional
                connection. It is important to note that sexual preference denotes a "choice" and has a negative connotation
                when used to describe the LGBTQ population.</p>
              <p><strong>Straight </strong>Pop culture term used to refer to individuals who identify as a heterosexual, meaning having a sexual,
                emotional, physical and relational attraction to individuals of the "opposite" gender/sex. The term "straight"
                often has a negative connotation within the LGBTQ population, because it suggested that non heterosexual
                individuals are "crooked" or "unnatural".</p>
              <p><strong>Transvestite </strong>An umbrella term, which refers to people who wear the clothing of the "opposite" gender. These
                individuals can be transgender, transsexual, cross dressers, Drag performers, or individuals who express
                their gender in a unique way. This term is often thought to be outdated, problematic, and generally offensive,
                since it was historically used to diagnose medical/mental health disorders.</p>
              <p><strong>Women Loving Women (WLW) </strong>Commonly used by communities of color to denote the attraction of women to women.</p>
              <p><strong>Zie & Hir </strong>The most common spelling for gender neutral pronouns. Zie is subjective (replaces he or she) and
                Hir is possessive and objective (replaces his or her).</p>
              <p><strong>TRANSGENDER GLOSSARY OF TERMS</strong></p>
              <p><strong>GENERAL TERMINOLOGY</strong></p>
              <p>Gender Identity One's internal, personal sense of being a man or a woman (or a boy or a girl). For transgender
                people, their birth-assigned sex and their own internal sense of gender identity do not match.</p>
              <p>Gender Expression External manifestation of one's gender identity, usually expressed through "masculine," "feminine"
                or gender-variant behavior, clothing, haircut, voice or body characteristics. Typically, transgender people
                seek to make their gender expression match their gender identity, rather than their birth-assigned sex.</p>
              <p>Sex The classification of people as male or female. At birth, infants are assigned a sex based on a combination
                of bodily characteristics including: chromosomes, hormones, internal reproductive organs, and genitals.</p>
              <p>Sexual Orientation Describes an individual's enduring physical, romantic and/or emotional attraction to another
                person. Gender identity and sexual orientation are not the same. Transgender people may be straight, lesbian,
                gay or bisexual. For example, a man who transitions from male to female and is attracted to other women would
                be identified as a lesbian or a gay woman.</p>
              <p><strong>TRANSGENDER-SPECIFIC TERMINOLOGY</strong></p>
              <p>Cross-Dressing To occasionally wear clothes traditionally associated with people of the other sex. Cross-dressers
                are usually comfortable with the sex they were assigned at birth and do not wish to change it. "Cross-dresser"
                should NOT be used to describe someone who has transitioned to live full-time as the other sex or who intends
                to do so in the future. Cross-dressing is a form of gender expression and is not necessarily tied to erotic
                activity. Cross-dressing is not indicative of sexual orientation.</p>
              <p>Gender Identity Disorder (GID) A controversial DSM-IV diagnosis given to transgender and other gender-variant
                people. Because it labels people as "disordered," Gender Identity Disorder is often considered offensive.
                The diagnosis is frequently given to children who don't conform to expected gender norms in terms of dress,
                play or behavior. Such children are often subjected to intense psychotherapy, behavior modification and/or
                institutionalization. Replaces the outdated term "gender dysphoria."</p>
              <p>Intersex Describing a person whose biological sex is ambiguous. There are many genetic, hormonal or anatomical
                variations that make a person's sex ambiguous (e.g., Klinefelter Syndrome). Parents and medical professionals
                usually assign intersex infants a sex and perform surgical operations to conform the infant's body to that
                assignment. This practice has become increasingly controversial as intersex adults speak out against the
                practice. The term intersex is not interchangeable with or a synonym for transgender.</p>
              <p>Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS) Refers to surgical alteration, and is only one small part of transition (see
                Transition above). Preferred term to "sex change operation." Not all transgender people choose to or can
                afford to have SRS.</p>
              <p>Transgender An umbrella term (adj.) for people whose gender identity and/or gender expression differs from
                the sex they were assigned at birth. The term may include but is not limited to: transsexuals, cross-dressers
                and other gender-variant people. Transgender people may identify as female-to-male (FTM) or male-to-female
                (MTF). Use the descriptive term (transgender, transsexual, cross-dresser, FTM or MTF) preferred by the individual.
                Transgender people may or may not decide to alter their bodies hormonally and/or surgically.</p>
              <p>Transition Altering one's birth sex is not a one-step process; it is a complex process that occurs over a long
                period of time. Transition includes some or all of the following personal, legal and medical adjustments:
                telling one's family, friends and/or co-workers; changing one's name and/or sex on legal documents; hormone
                therapy; and possibly (though not always) one or more forms of surgery.</p>
              <p>Transsexual (also Transexual) An older term which originated in the medical and psychological communities.
                While some transsexual people still prefer to use the term to describe themselves, many transgender people
                prefer the term transgender to transsexual. Unlike transgender, transsexual is not an umbrella term, as many
                transgender people do not identify as transsexual. It is best to ask which term an individual prefers.</p>
              <p><strong>TRANSGENDER TERMS TO AVOID</strong></p>
              <p><strong>PROBLEMATIC TERMS</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Problematic: "transgenders," "a transgender"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Preferred: "transgender people," "a transgender person"</strong></p>
              <p>Transgender should be used as an adjective, not as a noun. Do not say, "Tony is a transgender," or "The parade
                included many transgenders." Instead say, "Tony is a transgender man," or "The parade included many transgender
                people."</p>
              <p><strong>Problematic: "transgendered"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Preferred: "transgender" </strong>The adjective transgender should never have an extraneous "-ed" tacked onto the end.
                An "-ed" suffix adds unnecessary length to the word and can cause tense confusion and grammatical errors.
                For example, it is grammatically incorrect to turn transgender into a participle, as it is an adjective,
                not a verb, and only verbs can be used as participles by adding an "-ed" suffix.</p>
              <p><strong>Problematic: "sex change," "pre-operative," "post-operative"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Preferred: "transition" </strong>Referring to a sex change operation, or using terms such as pre- or post-operative,
                inaccurately suggests that one must have surgery in order to transition. Avoid overemphasizing surgery when
                discussing transgender people or the process of transition.</p>
              <p><strong>DEFAMATORY TERMS</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Defamatory: "deceptive," "fooling," "pretending," "posing" or "masquerading" </strong>Gender identity is an integral
                part of a person's identity. Do not characterize transgender people as "deceptive," as "fooling" other people,
                or as "pretending" to be, "posing" or "masquerading" as a man or a woman. Such descriptions are defamatory
                and insulting.</p>
              <p><strong>Defamatory: "she-male," "he-she," "it," "trannie," "tranny," "shim," "gender-bender" </strong>These words only serve
                to dehumanize transgender people and should not be used.</p>
              <p><strong>Defamatory: "bathroom bill" </strong>A new term created and used by far-right extremists to oppose non-discrimination
                laws that protect transgender people.</p>
              <p><strong>TRANSGENDER NAMES, PRONOUN USAGE & DESCRIPTIONS</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Always use a transgender person's chosen name. </strong>Often transgender people cannot afford a legal name change or
                are not yet old enough to change their name legally. They should be afforded the same respect for their chosen
                name as anyone else who lives by a name other than their birth name (e.g., celebrities).</p>
              <p><strong>Whenever possible, ask transgender people which pronoun they would like you to use. </strong>A person who identifies
                as a certain gender, whether or not that person has taken hormones or had some form of surgery, should be
                referred to using the pronouns appropriate for that gender.</p>
              <p><strong>If it is not possible to ask a transgender person which pronoun he or she prefers, use the pronoun that is
                consistent with the person's appearance and gender expression. </strong>For example, if a person wears a dress and
                uses the name Susan, feminine pronouns are appropriate.</p>
              <p><strong>It is never appropriate to put quotation marks around either a transgender person's chosen name or the pronoun
                that reflects that person's gender identity.</strong>
              </p>
              <p><strong>When describing transgender people, please use the correct term or terms to describe their gender identity.</strong>
                For example, a person who is born male and transitions to become female is a transgender woman, whereas a
                person who is born female and transitions to become male is a transgender man.
              </p>
              <p><strong>OFFENSIVE TERMS TO AVOID</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Offensive: "homosexual" (n. or adj.)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Preferred: "gay" (adj.); "gay man" or "lesbian" (n.); "gay person/people" </strong>Please use "gay" or "lesbian" to
                describe people attracted to members of the same sex. Because of the clinical history of the word "homosexual,"
                it is aggressively used by anti-gay extremists to suggest that gay people are somehow diseased or psychologically/emotionally
                disordered - notions discredited by the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association
                in the 1970s.</p>
              <p><strong>Offensive: "homosexual relations/relationship," "homosexual couple," "homosexual sex," etc.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Preferred: "relationship" (or "sexual relationship"), "couple" (or, if necessary, "gay couple"), "sex," etc.</strong></p>
              <p>Identifying a same-sex couple as "a homosexual couple," characterizing their relationship as "a homosexual
                relationship," or identifying their intimacy as "homosexual sex" is extremely offensive and should be avoided.</p>
              <p>As a rule, try to avoid labeling an activity, emotion or relationship "gay," "lesbian" or "bisexual" unless
                you would call the same activity, emotion or relationship "straight" if engaged in by someone of another
                orientation.</p>
              <p><strong>Offensive: "sexual preference"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Preferred: "sexual orientation" or "orientation" </strong>The term "sexual preference" is typically used to suggest
                that being lesbian, gay or bisexual is a choice and therefore can and should be "cured." Sexual orientation
                is the accurate description of an individual's enduring physical, romantic and/or emotional attraction to
                members of the same and/or opposite sex and is inclusive of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and straight men
                and women.</p>
              <p><strong>Offensive: "gay lifestyle" or "homosexual lifestyle"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Preferred: "gay lives," "gay and lesbian lives" </strong>There is no single lesbian, gay or bisexual lifestyle. Lesbians,
                gay men and bisexuals are diverse in the ways they lead their lives. The phrase "gay lifestyle" is used to
                denigrate lesbians and gay men, suggesting that their orientation is a choice and therefore can and should
                be "cured."</p>
              <p><strong>Offensive: "admitted homosexual" or "avowed homosexual"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Preferred: "openly lesbian," "openly gay," "openly bisexual" </strong>Dated term used to describe those who are openly
                lesbian, gay or bisexual or who have recently come out of the closet. The words "admitted" or "avowed" suggest
                that being gay is somehow shameful or inherently secretive.</p>
              <p><strong>DEFAMATORY LANGUAGE</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"fag," "faggot," "dyke," "homo," "sodomite," "she-male," "he-she," "it," "shim," "tranny" and similar epithets</strong>
                The criteria for using these derogatory terms should be the same as those applied to vulgar epithets used
                to target other groups.</p>
              <p><strong>"deviant," "disordered," "dysfunctional," "diseased," "perverted," "destructive" and similar descriptions </strong>The
                notion that being gay, lesbian or bisexual is a psychological disorder was discredited by the American Psychological
                Association and the American Psychiatric Association in the 1970s. Today, words such as "deviant," "diseased"
                and "disordered" often are used to portray gay people as less than human, mentally ill, or as a danger to
                society</p>
              <p><strong>Associating gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people or relationships with pedophilia, child abuse, sexual
                abuse, bestiality, bigamy, polygamy, adultery and/or incest </strong>Being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender is
                neither synonymous with nor indicative of any tendency toward pedophilia, child abuse, sexual abuse, bestiality,
                bigamy, polygamy, adultery and/or incest. Such claims, innuendoes and associations often are used to insinuate
                that lesbians and gay men pose a threat to society, to families, and to children in particular.</p>
